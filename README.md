Currently learning making requests using Callbacks, Promises and the Fetch API which is modern way of making requests from the browser with JavaScript.

In this exercise, I am using AXIOS libary.

We retrieve the user input and concatenate to the query string in order to make request. Once we reach the pure data which is an image array, we append them on body.
